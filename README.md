## Description

This tool leverages state-of-the-art language models, including MBart for translation and BART for summarization. It seamlessly integrates these models to provide efficient and accurate summarization and translation services. The interface is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to quickly summarize and translate articles with just a few clicks.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you need to install the following dependencies:

- **gradio**: Gradio is a Python library that allows you to create interfaces for your machine learning models. It provides a simple interface for building web-based UIs.
  
  You can install gradio via pip:

```
pip install gradio
```

- **transformers**: Transformers is a popular Python library by Hugging Face that provides state-of-the-art natural language processing models, including BART and MBart.

You can install transformers via pip:

```
pip install transformers
```

Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and consider using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies cleanly. Additionally, make sure you have an internet connection during installation, as some dependencies might require downloading pre-trained models.

## Note

Please note that the summarization and translation quality may vary depending on the complexity of the input article and the selected languages. Additionally, as this tool utilizes pre-trained models, the performance may be influenced by the data used during training.
